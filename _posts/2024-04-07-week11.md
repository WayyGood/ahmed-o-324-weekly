title: Week 11 - Clock is Ticking

## End is near, much to fear, my renewed commitment...
Give or take, a month left for the course to end and not a single contribution made... yet. I'm using this post not only to fulfill my weekly blog obligation, but also to write out and declare a new commitment to throw myself into the deep end of open source, not only for this class but also personal benefit. I realized lately that I too quickly gave up on the possibility of becoming a software engineer due to the current market, but I've been reflecting further and just realized I have to really try. This prompted me to understand that this class is 1. A commitment I made when I registered for the course, and 2. in fact, out of all classes, the most relevant to achieving my career goals and deserves my full dedication and attention. Hoping nobody reads this post as it's more personal and therapeutic.




## What's next...
Development environment setup at its very final step, just having issues compiling but should sort it out by the end of today. Other than that, I've been thinking about other open source contributions I can start making to be considered individual contributions. I am being a bit picky because I intend to continue my own contribitions even after this course is over, but a sense of urgency is increasing so by next blog post I will have decided on what I'll contribute to. Whoever reads this, wish me luck!
