title: Week 13 - The Stick Moves
---


## Momentum 
Finally, I am beginning to feel like progress is being made. Everybody got their development environments set up, and we have been aggressively attacking new issues that arise. I was able to solve one of the issues successfully before requesting assignment, as per requirement, and now am only waiting for a reply on their end. The experience of looking through the code and finding where the issues arised was very valuable, as it got be through all the hiccups of what it's like to do such a thing and I can now repeat the same process a lot quicker and with more confidence. Before this, the task of contributing to a large project was very intimidating, but now that I've gotten my foot wet I have to say, I have become a lot less anxious,


## Next Steps
With my newfound vigor and confidence, I am pleased and excited to to tackle another 2-3 issues by the end of the week. I look at them and they seem a lot more doable now. Cole was able to get a PR in which is great! Today I plan to get one issue sorted out and request assignment, and then tomorrow post a big issue I encountered but I also believe I can tackle. Finally I will try to do the same on Sunday, and if noone replies to my assignment requests by then, I'm gonna shift my focus to getting them to assign it to me, so that I can create PR's and merge in bulk. Can't wait!
