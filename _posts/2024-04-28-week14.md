title: Week 14 - Attention! ... i'm locking in ...
---


## Grabbing attention
Good news is, the developers responded to my proposed solution to my issue! I was genuinely very worried that they wouldn't given how long they took. The first challenging phase of this endeavour was to get the issue solved and submit that solution so that the developers would give me the green light to get assigned and make a pull request. The second obstacle which I didn't expect was how hard it was to keep a consistent flow of communication between assigners and myself. At the times they'd answer I would happen to not see it, and vice versa. I think the lesson I got from this is, no matter how annoying you think it might be, to kindly yet consistently reach out until they answer; in other words, to be persistent. Normally this kind of thing wouldn't stress me out, but given my desire to get a merge before we present it has been propelling me to get this solution into a pull request quickly, and finally merged.


## ... i'm Locking in...
You heard that right, today till end of Monday, I'm locking in, or in other words I'm about to exert insane amounts of production, focus and execution. Can't wait to see if I hit my PR, presentation, and other targets.
